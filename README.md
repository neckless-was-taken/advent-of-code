# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎅🏻
This repo contains my* puzzle solutions for Advent of Code. The solutions should work for any given puzzle input, definitely worked for my puzzle inputs.

I do AoC for fun and to better my Python/programming skills, my first ever experience coding in Python was Advent of Code 2022. And previous programming experience has been extremely limited.



## Input obfuscation
The puzzle inputs are submoduled in a private repository as per the r/aoc FAQ:
> Do not commit your puzzle input into your repo or at least not do not share the input publicly; use .gitignore or equivalent.
