# Advent of Code
Puzzle solutions for Advent of Code. The solutions should work for any given puzzle input, definitely worked for my puzzle inputs.

## Structure
The inputs are submoduled in a private repository as per the aoc [creator's request](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081)
> In general I ask people not to publish their inputs, just to make it harder for someone to try to steal the whole site. The answer is probably fine, but also probably not very interesting since they vary per person.
