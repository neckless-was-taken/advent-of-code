# üéÑ Advent of Code üéÖüèª
Puzzle solutions for Advent of Code. The solutions should work for any given puzzle input, definitely worked for my puzzle inputs.

I do Advent of Code for fun and to better my Python/programming skills, my first ever experience in coding in Python was Advent of Code 2022 and it clearly shows.

These solutions aren't the best way to go about solving the puzzles and clearly shows how much I lean on the tools that I know how to use when there might be a better way to solve the puzzle using one of pythons built in libraries or a module from PyPi.

## Input obfuscation
The puzzle inputs are submoduled in a private repository as per the creator's request
> In general I ask people not to publish their inputs, just to make it harder for someone to try to steal the whole site
